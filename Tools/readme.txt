*General Info

A "trainer" is a third-party program that is designed to alter memory locations 
of running programs (games). In order for a trainer to work, it must be running 
simultaneously with the game it was written for. Do not close the trainer until 
you are finished playing the game. Since trainers are written to alter Specific 
memory locations, they usually only work with specific versions of the game. 
This is the most common problem when trainers seem to be "not working".

CES is searching for experienced members who like working in a unified team, so 
if you think: 'Hey ! That fits to me', visit our webpage, inform yourself about 
CES and get in touch with us ASAP.

*Disclaimer

This program has been tested and provided to you "AS IS", meaning we do not 
take any responsibility for anything you do with it. It has been tested and 
should work perfectly on your system.
