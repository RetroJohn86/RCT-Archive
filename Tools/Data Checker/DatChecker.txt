Humble Programmer  Freeware - DatChecker

DatChecker is a utility designed to catalog and validate all of the object
(*.DAT) files used by the game Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2).  In addition,
beginning with v1.5 of DatChecker, the graphic images associated with each
object can be viewed by double-clicking on the object.

    Latest Version

*v1.12* / 27 Jul '11 / md5sum:  3a1ef1fcc278d5c6f48f9f3371757ca0

    Installation & Usage

Copy the DatChecker.exe file to your Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 directory
(typically C:\Program Files\Infogrames\Rollercoaster Tycoon 2).  Double
click on the icon to start the application, and enter the directory of
the RCT2 ObjData folder in the edit box at the top, or click on the
'...' button and select any folder that contains *.DAT files.

Once the folder is selected, click on the "Check" button to examine all
the *.DAT files therein, or manually drag one or more *.DAT files and
drop them on the main DatChecker window.

Clicking on the "Export" button will create a file named DatChecker.csv
in the same directory as the DatChecker.exe file.  This is a text file
containing all of the object data in "Comma Separated Value" format.

The following information is displayed for each .DAT file:

  *Status*  Green flag (OK), Yellow flag (WARNING), or Red flag (ERROR).
  *Source*  RCT2    Original game
            WW      Wacky Worlds add-on
            TT      Time Twister add-on
            custom  User-created object
            ??      Unrecognized object type
  *File*  .DAT file name.
  *Name*  Internal object name.
  *Type*  Type of object.
  *Size*  Size of the (uncompressed) object data in bytes.
  *MD5 Hash*  A unique 128-bit signature of the uncompressed object data.
  *Strings*  First entry in the object's string table.
  *Details*  Information as to why a flag is yellow (warning)
             or red (fatal error).

In addition, you can right-click on any object line and select one or more
of the following options from the context menu:

  *View...*  Displays the object's graphic image; the image will be scaled
             to fit the window.
  *Properties*  Displays the following information about the selected object:
    * Size of the file in bytes
    * Date the file was first created/installed
    * Date the file was last changed
    * Internal CRC of the compressed object data and name
    * Number of internal images
    * String Table entries
  *Remove*  Removes the selected object from the list.  This doesn't affect
            the .DAT file in any way, it just removes the item from the list.
  *Archive*  Adds the selected object file to the DatChecker Archive.zip file,
             then deletes the original *.DAT file.  *Note*: if the file
             could not be added to the .zip archive, it is *not* deleted.
  *Clone*  Create a duplicate of the selected object with a different
           object name.
  *Delete*  Permanently deletes the *.DAT file for the selected object
            and removes it from the list.  *Warning*: this action cannot
            be undone!

    Mini-FAQ

*Q:* Why do I need this utility?
*A:* When RCT2 loads a corrupt or invalid object file, it exits with an
error... but doesn't tell you which *.DAT file caused it.  This utility
will make sure all your .DAT files are OK by identifying any objects
with bad CRCs or corrupt data.  In addition, it will also identify all
custom objects so that they can be removed from your ObjData folder.

*Q:* Which versions of Windows will DatChecker run on?
*A:* DatChecker uses features of the Windows user interface that were
first introduced in Windows 2000 and/or Windows ME, some of which have
been retrofitted to earlier versions through Service Packs or Internet
Explorer updates.  DatChecker will display a warning on older versions
of Windows, but will still try to run as best it can.  There were some
initial reports about the window re-sizing not working under Windows 98,
but I've never been able to duplicate the problem.  DatChecker is fully
compatible with 64-bit systems.

*Q:* Can I use it to find duplicate objects?
*A:* Yes: sort the display by MD5 Hash, and any files with the same
'fingerprint' are duplicates.  Unlike the internal CRC, which includes the
object name, the MD5 Hash is based only on the uncompressed object data,
so two or more objects with identical data (but different names) will
have the same MD5 values.

*Q:* How does 'archiving' work?
*A:* Right-click on a selected object to display the context menu, and
select *Archive*.  This will add the object file to DatChecker Archive.zip
and then delete the original *.DAT file if successful.  To 'undo' this action,
extract the file from DatChecker Archive.zip, which is created in the same
directory as the DatChecker.exe program file, using WinZip or any
work-alike utility.

*Q:* DatChecker says that *ALL* of my object files are invalid!
What's going on?
*A:* DatChecker compares the object CRC and size against those
distributed with the *US version* of RCT2 and the expansion packs (Wacky
Worlds and Time Twister), so this may happen if you are using a version
released in a different country or language.  To stop DatChecker from
verifying objects, create a shortcut to the DatChecker.exe program and
add the parameter --noverify to the command line.

*Q:* I don't recognize the ride that is displayed in the screen shot.
What is it?
*A:* The ride depicted in the screen shot is the Tilted Whirler by The
Amazing Earl <http://www.amazingearl.com>, and was used with his consent.

*Q:* What's with the weird colors in the object images?  They don't
look anything like what's displayed in the game...
*A:* Many objects are 're-colorable', i.e., the user can change the
color of parts of the object when it is placed on the map.  These are
more correctly known as 'map-able' colors, and are displayed in the
object image window as shades of bright green and purple.

*Q:* Can I turn off the gridlines in the object image view?
*A:* Yes: create a shortcut to the DatChecker.exe program and add the
parameter --nogrid to the command line.

*Q:* I found a bug...can you fix it?
*A:* Yes, but only if you can describe the problem well enough for me
to re-create it.  At the very least, I'll need the .DAT file that caused
the error; you don't need to go into great detail about your computer,
but knowing which version of Windows you're using would help.  This
utility was tested on XP and 2000, but your mileage may vary.

*Q:* Is DatChecker really free?
*A:* Yup.  Besides, any money I could make from selling it wouldn't
even begin to cover the legal expenses of being sued by Infogrames for
the rather blatant copyright infringement(s).  If you like it, send me a
note telling me what you like about it...that's enough payment in itself.
