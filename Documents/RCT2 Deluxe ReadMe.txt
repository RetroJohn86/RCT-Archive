     *****************************************************


Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 Known Issues
-----------------------------------

The Six Flags tracks cannot be saved or modified. When you view 
one you will notice the save icon will not be enabled.

If you are experienceing any sound issues, try toggling the 
'Forced Software Buffer Mixing' option on the game's main options
window.  

When creating a scenario and setting the objective to 
"Number of Guests" there will also be an automatic objective of
keeping the park rating above a certain number. 

When creating a scenario and setting the objective to 
"# of roller coasters" there will also be an automatic objective
of keeping the excitement value of the coasters above a
certain number. 

In the scenario "Six Flags Great Adventure" the number 
of guests is checked at the end of a day. You may see your 
number of guests exceed 3000, and some time pass before the 
objective is completed. 

In the Rainbow Summit scenario, the description of "tall" means 
building above the tree line.


Time Twister Known Issues
-------------------------

Some coasters may show a different number of cars available in 
the color menu than are actually available on the ride. This will
not affect the performance of the game.

In some scenarios, the Sky Tower Ride may also serve as a 
transport ride from one location to another e.g. from the base 
of a cliff to the top.

Maintenance workers will need to be placed inside their "patrol"
regions once the region is set for them to stay in the region.

Some rides have locked colors, even though the paint option is 
not disabled. This will not affect the performance of the game.

Some trees may remain even after using the demolish scenery tool.

Some landscape in some scenarios may not be altered.


Wacky Worlds Known Issues

scenery will not be removed.

viewing the dialog boxes.

                       4.  TROUBLESHOOTING
                            
                     ***********************


Video Problems
--------------
The vast majority of problems that you are likely to encounter 
are probably related to drivers that allow the game to make 
optimum use of your systems resources. In particular, video 
games are most influenced by Microsoft’s DirectX drivers, which 
are responsible for various aspects of your system including: 
video, sound, controller input, 3D graphic functions, 
CD/DVD-ROM access and other functions. If you do experience 
problems, always ensure that you are using the latest drivers 
for these devices, and that your DirectX installation shows 
these devices as being certified (with DXDIAG).


CD/DVD-ROM Problems
-------------------
Make sure that the CD/DVD-ROM disc is in the correct drive,
with the label facing upwards. The CD/DVD-ROM disc must be 
in the drive to install or run the game. If you have two 
CD/DVD-ROM drives, the CD/DVD must be placed in the drive 
whose drive letter comes alphabetically first for the game to 
work.
Ensure that the CD/DVD-ROM disc is free from any markings or
scratches which may interfere with normal operation. If the 
disc requires cleaning, gently wipe the surface with a dry, 
non-abrasive cloth.


Sound Problems
--------------
Make sure that your speakers or headphones are plugged into the 
correct socket, and that the volume control is at an appropriate 
level. If you are using powered speakers, ensure that the power 
is on.
If you continue to experience problems, ensure that the Volume 
Control taskbar icon (depicted by a small yellow speaker) 
is present. 
Double-clicking this icon will open the Volume Control window. 
Make sure that the Wave and Master Volume controls are set at an 
appropriate level and that the Mute feature is not enabled.


Debugger Detected Error
-----------------------
Q: When I try to launch the game I get the following error:
   "Debugger detected  - please close it down and restart.
   Windows NT users: Please note that having the WinIce/SoftIce
   service installed means that you are running a debugger." I do
   not believe I am running a debugger. What could be the
   problem?

A: This error is caused by DivX 5.1. The issue you have mentioned
   is a bug in this release of the DivX codec. The codec is
   actually what`s showing the error, and shutting down Blaze
   Media Pro because it is erroneously detecting the software as
   a debugger. You can resolve the issue by updating to DivX
   5.1.1 http://www.divx.com, and you will no longer have this
   problem. If you do still have any problems please contact 
   Mastertronic Technical Support.
